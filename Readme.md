## Project Summary
We aim to build a website which allows users to check for detailed information of the car so that it could aim users to buy the favourite car which they want. So the detail information would include Model, year, color price and miles. We will also include a recall model which could check the reason, components, and brand of recalled vehicle. Users could check the specific car he looking for, to check whether it has been recall or not, so it is consider to the safety. What is more, this website will also include position information on specific car, user  and car company. User would know what is the distance between the specific car he is looking for and himself, so that it helps user to make consideration about whether to buy this car or not.  Car family also provides company table so that user could know which company a car belongs to, and the site shows the company's location.  
## Description
Car Family is a web platform to help users quickly sort and find the cars that people are looking for, it could also help people determine whether they should  buy a used car based on price. The project involves designing, sorting, combining, and filtering the database so that it helps the user to find their best car. Our platform would include the information of brand, Model, color, Year of car,Price.  Based on all the information above, user could determine whether they want to buy or sell the car or not.

Car family also provide recall and car history functionality. As for recall, user could directly type the recall Id to see whether the specific car has been recalled or not. Based on this information, user could know the car they choose whether it has design flaws or not.The recall include reason, report reveived date, recallID, component, consequence summary. If the car has been recalled, it could also show the reason and components they recall. As for car campany,user could know which company a car belongs to, and the site shows the company's location. As a result, both recall and company would help user to determine buy the car.
Also, based on the Car Family platform, users could also search for the car location, and it would tell you how far does user from this car. It would help user to determine the distance between user and this car.

We will also use MySQL to search the data from the database and SQL to establish the database. We will also use HTML5, CSS, Javascript, React.js to design our frontend webpage. 



## Usefulness
The website we build aims for potential customers who are interested in purchasing cars but they may not know what to choose. In this case this website allows them to have access to information about the car they like immediately. Also if they do not have any brand preferences, this website can find the car that is most suitable for them based on their preferences(Ex: price above $30000). Beside this, users can also calculation the distance between user and specific car which they looking for.

There are similar websites such as Cars, Carfax, Edmunds. But our website is different because our website could show whether this car has been recalled or not, and it show which component and reason does this car been recall. We put user safety first. And I believe safety is the number one factor when users consider whether to buy this car.
## Realness
We use 5 databases include uesrs,carmodels,recall,company and location. All of these datasets are from kaggle.com, and it is a CSV file. These datasets have information about uses' location,name,email,password. Include CarModels' carid,companyid,locationid,model,year,color,miles,price. Include recalls' Recallid, carid, Report received date, Reason, Consequence summary,Component. Include company CompanyID, Created date, Company Name. Include location: LocationID, cityname, latitude,longitude.
